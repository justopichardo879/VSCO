The AI engineer meticulously developed a comprehensive AI-powered website generator, addressing critical bug fixes and massive feature expansions. Initially, the focus was on resolving the non-functional project deletion and then fixing pervasive issues within the AI enhancement system, including backend logic errors and frontend response handling. A significant effort was dedicated to repairing the core website generator, which suffered from database validation conflicts and persistent AI API timeouts, necessitating data normalization and robust timeout implementations. Subsequently, the engineer evolved the AI model integration to support a granular selection of both commercial (OpenAI, Gemini) and 17+ local open-source LLMs, complete with intelligent fallback mechanisms. The most recent task involves building a real-time dual-panel code editor with live preview, a significant architectural shift towards a Framer/CodeSandbox-like experience. This iterative development showcases a strong emphasis on user experience, system stability, and advanced AI integration, always verifying functionality through systematic testing and adapting to user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The application's core requirement is to be an ultra-professional AI-powered website generation tool, evolving from a VSCode clone. It must integrate OpenAI (GPT-4.1) and Google Gemini (2.5 Pro) for one-click site generation with real-time previews and full Spanish UI localization. Key project management features include viewing, editing, deleting, and downloading HTML/CSS/JS. The View Projects section needed to be an ultra-visual fullscreen gallery with live previews. Edit Project was to be enhanced with AI-driven suggestions and conversational modification capabilities, with the AI explaining changes. Future vision includes an Ultimate Project Builder supporting advanced tech stacks (React 19, Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS 4, TypeScript 5, FastAPI, Node.js 22+, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Docker, C++, Python 3.12+, PyTorch), CI/CD, AI, data analysis, and instant deployment. A recent critical request was integrating 17+ open-source LLMs (Llama 3, Mistral, Qwen 2, etc.) for local, offline generation with auto-detection and intelligent fallback, while maintaining existing API integrations. The latest request is for a real-time dual-panel code editor (left: editable code, right: live preview) with visual component manipulation, akin to CodeSandbox/Framer.

<current_work>
The application has recently undergone a massive overhaul to its AI capabilities and core functionalities. The immediate prior work before this summary was dedicated to a significant architectural enhancement: integrating a wide array of LLM models, encompassing both commercial APIs (OpenAI GPT-3.5/4.1/4o, Google Gemini 1.5 Flash/Pro/2.5 Pro Preview) and over 17 local open-source models (Llama 3, Mistral, Qwen 2, DeepSeek Coder, Phi-3, Gemma, etc.). This integration includes an intelligent fallback system for local models and a dynamically updated frontend UI that allows users to select specific models and view their descriptions.

This complex integration was successfully completed, confirmed by both backend API testing and frontend visual checks, demonstrating the hybrid nature and robustness of the AI generation system, including 100% offline capability.

Immediately following this, the user requested the implementation of a real-time dual-panel code editor:
-   **User Request**: Al crear una aplicacion web la interfaz esté dividida en tiempo real en dos paneles principales: Panel izquierdo: Mostrar el código fuente... Panel derecho: Mostrar la vista previa instantánea... El sistema permita editar tanto el código como manipular visualmente los componentes, sincronizando ambos paneles.
