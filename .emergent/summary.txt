<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic application into a sophisticated AI-powered website generator. The development followed an iterative approach, meticulously addressing user requirements and bug reports. Key phases included initial AI integration with OpenAI and Gemini, a complete interface translation to Spanish, the implementation of robust project management features (view, edit, delete, download), and a significant upgrade to a highly visual, interactive project gallery with live preview capabilities. A conversational AI modification system was then integrated, allowing users to enhance projects via natural language prompts, with the AI detailing its changes. The work consistently prioritized modern UI/UX, scalability, and AI-driven enhancements, aiming for a Framer/Webflow-like experience. The engineer consistently validated changes, especially after major feature additions or bug fixes, ensuring a stable and evolving product.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested transforming a VSCode Clone into a website generation tool from a single prompt. This evolved into a requirement for an ultra-professional application integrating OpenAI (GPT-4.1) and Google Gemini (2.5 Pro) for one-click website generation, offering AI selection and real-time previews. Key features included full Spanish localization for the UI, and comprehensive project management: viewing, editing, deleting, and downloading HTML/CSS/JS.

Subsequent demands focused on an enhanced View Projects section, envisioned as a fullscreen, highly visual, modern gallery (akin to Notion/Framer), featuring large cards, images, animations, and dynamic details. A live preview functionality (Figma/Webflow style) was critical for real-time feedback during development. The Edit Project functionality was to be augmented with AI-driven automatic visual and functional improvement suggestions. The user then requested the ability to modify and add sections via custom prompts, with the AI explaining applied changes conversationally. The ultimate goal is an Ultimate Project Builder supporting advanced tech stacks (React 19, Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS 4, TypeScript 5, shadcn/ui, FastAPI, Node.js 22+, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Docker, C++, Python 3.12+, PyTorch), ensuring scalable, modern, visual projects with CI/CD, AI, data analysis, and instant deployment capabilities.

<current_work>
The application has transitioned from a basic VSCode Clone to a sophisticated AI-powered website generation and editing platform. Users can now generate professional websites using OpenAI GPT-4.1 or Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. These generated projects are saved to a MongoDB database and displayed in an ultra-visual fullscreen gallery, inspired by Framer/Notion, featuring large interactive cards with live thumbnails and animations.

A critical bug where the View Project button was not showing project content in the iframe has been resolved. The iframe now correctly displays the generated website with real-time preview, offering functional controls for viewport (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet), refresh, and an inspect mode with a grid overlay.

Project management includes the ability to edit project names/descriptions, download individual files (HTML, CSS, JS) or the entire project, and delete projects. A major recent addition is the AI-powered enhancement system: users can apply automatic improvements (color palette, content, SEO, responsiveness, animations) or engage in a conversational chat. In this chat, users describe desired modifications in natural language (e.g., add testimonials, make it more modern), and the AI applies these changes and provides a detailed explanation of what was done. The entire interface is also fully translated into Spanish.

Immediately prior to this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just finished implementing the interactive AI chat modification system. The user then inquired Que paso aqui?, indicating a non-integration of the Ultimate Project Builder component, which the AI engineer acknowledged. However, the user then immediately redirected the task to Actualizame la funcion borrar proyectos, which is the current work being addressed.
